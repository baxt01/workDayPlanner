# workDayPlanner

## Description 
This a fun little codebase to display a workday schedule,
This app uses the dayjs library and the jquery library,
using the dayjs library I have set a 9-5 day hourly block,
then I check is the current hour the same as the ID in the HTML,
if it is the same set the class to present else its a class of future or past,
using these classes set the background color of the time blocks.
setup the local storage to save the time block data and a clear button to remove the data at the end of a day.
